### What I learned

In this project, I used some CSS properties to help with responsive font size, such as @media
and pseudo-elements and hover effect

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

.ingredients ul li::marker {
color: var(--p_bigger-color);
font-size: 10px;
}
.ingredients ul li {
padding-left:15px;
font-size: 14px;
color: var(--p_color);
margin-bottom: 10px;
}

### Continued development

I want to learn more about responsive websites and how to use the pseudo-elements and hover effect
